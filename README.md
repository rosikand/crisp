# CRISP

Our CS 197 research project repo. 


## Folder structure 

To keep the repo organized, I think the following structure makes sense: 

- `code`
	- `code/species-classification`
	- `code/distribution-modeling`
		- `code/species-classification/supervised_baseline`
		- `code/species-classification/clip_pretraining`
		- `code/distribution-modeling/supervised_baseline`
		- `code/distribution-modeling/clip_pretraining`
